North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union, China,[13] and other communist allies; South Vietnam was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies.[59][60] The war is widely considered to be a Cold War-era proxy war.[61] It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973.
